\begin{abstract}
    Operating Systems are developed in order to have the best optimization and operation for different processor architectures. Their design is a careful process, as several emerging technologies are constantly being disseminated. In this work, we present the development of the port of the Nanvix operating system to a RISC-V architecture, which will be emulated by a tool called PULP SDK. To verify the effectiveness of the port, automated tests were performed, from kernel to user level.
